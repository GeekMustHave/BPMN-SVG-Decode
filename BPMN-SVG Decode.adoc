Attempt to see if the SVG generated from BPMN can be updated by Inkscape with Title and description 
whicj will be read later to automatically generate documentation.

== Introduction

We are taking BMPN.IO SVG output file and reading it into Inkscape for updating Title and Descriptionh.

NOTE: It would be preferred if we could do this with `*.BPMN` file.  This file is XML formatted and extremely complex.

.Test Files
[options="header"]
|===
| File name | Content
| spmn-sample.svg | Larger DWIP flow diagram with title, descriptions and color
| g5583.svg | Single element on the flow diagram `Status: Subnitted` 
|===

NOTE: g5583.svg. This version of the file was manually cut out of the larger flow diagram.

== Solution

Use Node and some NPM modules to perform the HTML to JSON conversion.
We are doing this to make the searching of the SVG eaiser and quicker.

=== GIT repository

Use a local GIT repository and attempt to publish to GitHub account.

NOTE: In past attempts at this it failed because I added the readme.md on 
GITHib and was unable to push it back to this local repository.

Initialize this repository with a README
This will let you immediately clone the repository to your computer.
Skip this step if youâ€™re importing an existing repository.

.Cooamnds to push local repository
----
git remote add origin https://github.com/GeekMustHave/BPMN-SVG-Decode.git
git push -u origin master
----

== nodemon

Nodemon is a utility that will monitor for any changes in your source and automatically restart your server

.initial install of nodemon
----
npm install nodemon -g
----

.Update the `package.json` to use `nodemonnpm start
