Attempt to see if the SVG generated from BPMN can be updated by Inkscape with Title and description 
whicj will be read later to automatically generate documentation.

== Introduction

We are taking BMPN.IO SVG output file and reading it into Inkscape for updating Title and Descriptionh.

NOTE: It would be preferred if we could do this with `*.BPMN` file.  This file is XML formatted and extremely complex.

.Test Files
[options="header"]
|===
| File name | Content
| spmn-sample.svg | Larger DWIP flow diagram with title, descriptions and color
| g5583.svg | Single element on the flow diagram `Status: Subnitted` 
|===

NOTE: g5583.svg. This version of the file was manually cut out of the larger flow diagram.
